# Product/Orders Management App
### Technical Assignment for [Mr.Marvis](https://www.mrmarvis.com/nl)


This project is a front-end application designed to manage product orders. Users can view, filter, and update orders, including modifying their status and handling inventory stock. The application features a clean and responsive interface, and integrates with mock APIs to simulate real-world scenarios such as updating product quantities and calculating total revenue based on order statuses.

While this project covers a range of functionalities and interactions, it certainly dives into a level of complexity that might be a touch more nuanced than typically expected in a coding test. Nevertheless, it was completed with careful attention to detail and quality.
